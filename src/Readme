This directory contains source code for parsing the Plan 9 file system
trace files.  The included files are
	
Readme	- this file
Notice	- terms of use
Makefile - simple makefile
inflate.c - decompresses blocks of data encoded in deflate format
trace.h - header file to be included by client applications
trace.c - parser
super.c - sample application; lists all the super blocks in one of more trace files

The trace.h header declares a number of constants and types and a
single entry point:

	TrBlock *trRead(FILE*);

This function reads a record from the given trace file and advances
the file pointer to the next record.  The function returns a data
structure that contains all the information available in the trace
record.  The returned structure is allocated using malloc; the memory
should be reclaimed using free.

Random access to records can be implemented by an application by
recording the location of the file pointer before reading a record and
then seeking back to that location and rereading the record.  Eof and
parse errors are indicated by returning a NULL value.  There is
currently no way to distinguish between these two conditions.
